# Django_Recipe_project
This project allows authenticated users to add new recipes through a form, with data stored in a relational database using Django's ORM and displayed in a styled table with full CRUD functionality. Users must log in to submit recipes, and new users are required to register before accessing these features. Images are managed through a media directory, and Django forms handle submissions, while template inheritance ensures a consistent layout across the site.
